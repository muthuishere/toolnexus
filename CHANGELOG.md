# Changelog

All six ports (js / python / golang / java / csharp / elixir) are versioned and released
together; entries here apply to every port unless a port is named. Releases are cut as
GitHub Releases `vX.Y.Z` via `release.yml` (see `PUBLISHING.md`).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Agent runtime + sub-agents in all six ports** (`SPEC.md §7D`, OpenSpec change
  `add-subagents`). A new `agents` namespace per port (never colliding with the A2A
  `Agent`): `agent(name, { does, uses, soul/soulFile, team, budget, model, waitFor,
  onSpawn, onClose })` with `.run(prompt)` and `.asTool()` — an Agent IS a Tool. Delegation
  runs through a built-in `task { agent, prompt }` tool (team-scoped, opt-in per
  definition): isolated child transcript, one tool message back, usage roll-up, parallel
  task calls. Underneath: a Handle state machine with six host verbs
  (`spawn/post/wake/wait/interrupt/close`), two delivery rails, three loud backpressure
  gates, hierarchical live-enforced budgets, §10 suspension escalation with durable resume
  by task-key reattachment, and a per-port cancellation contract.

### Changed — action may be required

- **`RunResult.status` gains `"incomplete"`** (QG5). A `maxTurns` stop that still had tool
  calls in flight — on the plain client `run`/`ask`/`stream` loops as well as agent runs —
  now returns `status: "incomplete"` plus `limit: "maxTurns"` (idiomatic casing per port)
  instead of a silent `"done"`. Any limit stop (turns, tokens, tool calls, wall clock) is
  loud and names its limit; partial work and the transcript are preserved. **Code that
  matches `status === "done"` after hitting `maxTurns` must update** to handle
  `"incomplete"`. The full closed status vocabulary is now
  `"done" | "pending" | "incomplete" | "interrupted" | "closed" | "timeout" | "error"`,
  identical strings in all six ports.
